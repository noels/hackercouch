# Hacker Couch

**Pledge your couch to hackers!**

1. Fork this repository and put in your couch and/or travel info.
2. Manually add "Issues" to your fork by clicking the "Admin" tab in your fork.
3. Other hackers can [search](https://github.com/search?q=hackercouch+berlin) to find your info.
4. To request a stay or invite fellow hackers, open an issue in the tracker.

Itâ€™s like CouchSurfing, except CouchSurfing sucks. So does AirBnB, hostels and hotels. Why not stay with fellow hackers when traveling?


## Crash my couch

* couch in London, near Chancery Lane.

## Have me crash your couch

I'm going to Puppetcamp and FOSDEM so would love to crash your couch if Ghent for 31 Jan to 1 Feb or Brussels for 2nd and 3rd, that would be ace.
